# 🚀 100 Days of DevOps with KodeKloud Engineer Platform

This repository documents my journey through the **100 Days of DevOps** challenge using the [KodeKloud Engineer Platform](https://kodekloudhub.github.io/kodekloud-engineer/).  
It provides **step-by-step guidance**, **infrastructure details**, and **project-based learning** to master real-world DevOps practices.

## 📌 Project Overview

The KodeKloud Engineer Platform offers **hands-on labs** that simulate real-world DevOps environments.  
One of the major case studies is the **Nautilus Project**, where we act as DevOps engineers helping the Nautilus team manage and scale their IT infrastructure.

## 🏗️ Infrastructure Details

The platform mimics **real corporate IT environments**, consisting of multiple servers and roles.  
You will get hands-on with:

- **Application Servers** – Hosting web and backend services.
- **Database Servers** – MySQL, MongoDB, and other database systems.
- **Storage Servers** – Centralized file storage.
- **Load Balancers** – Distributing application traffic.
- **Monitoring & Logging** – Tools like Prometheus, Grafana, ELK stack.
- **CI/CD Pipelines** – Jenkins, GitLab CI, GitHub Actions.
- **Containerization & Orchestration** – Docker and Kubernetes clusters.
